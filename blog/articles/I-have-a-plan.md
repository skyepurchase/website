# I Have a Plan

Long story short I will have a year _and a bit_ to play with to figure out what I want to do with my life.

Though the plan was not to have a year _and a bit_ to play with I always had plans in the back of my head were this to occur throughout the last year.
In essence, I want to continue into academia and having just finished my undergraduate degree the ideal next step would be to go straight into a masters degree having applied earlier on.
However, I am taking a year out and applying for masters in the coming months to start in 2024 ... hopefully.

This isn't really a gap year, I won't be travelling around the world, instead I intend to learn more about my subject or rather the mathematics underlying my subject.
I feel with the pandemic over my A levels and some ability to deal with most concepts on the fly I've been able to get by without thorough understanding (this is likely the cause of the gap year) but this is not the state I wish to continue in.
The goal is a somewhat deep dive into a selection of first (potentially second) year undergraduate mathematics particularly helpful in machine learning and proof & logic.

In the short term I hope to write up and ideally publish my undergraduate dissertation on graph neural network explainability.
Maybe carrying out a few more experiments along lines that look promising or are new avenues of thought, as far as I am aware.
In tandem, properly open sourcing my previous research endeavour.

Though I could do the classic thing and live with my parents for a year (or indefinitely), and I am incredibly grateful for that stop gap, I have some funds saved up so after the usual holiday period I wish to enter the "real world".
My goal is to get a short term job, ideally in somehow involved in research, hopefully near other people actively in research, or in the very least something that pays basic bills and gives me some time.
That could be a very lofty goal and I may have a massive comeuppance. I will see and you may already know.

I hope to have more regular blogs detailing this journey as it unfolds either as a "This is how I did xyz to achieve abc" or potentially "Don't do xyz you won't get anywhere".
