        <p>Long story short I will have a year <em>and a bit</em> to
        play with to figure out what I want to do with my life. Though
        the plan was not to have a year <em>and a bit</em> to play with
        I always had plans in the back of my head were this to occur
        throughout the last year.</p>
        <p>This isn’t really a gap year, I won’t be travelling around
        the world, instead I intend to learn more about my subject or
        rather the mathematics underlying my subject. I feel with the
        pandemic over my A levels and some ability to deal with most
        concepts on the fly I’ve been able to get by without thorough
        understanding (this is likely the cause of the gap year) but
        this is not the state I wish to continue in. The goal is a
        somewhat deep dive into a selection of first year undergraduate
        mathematics particularly helpful in machine learning and proof
        &amp; logic.</p>
        <p>In the short term I hope to write up and ideally publish my
        undergraduate dissertation on graph neural network
        explainability. Maybe carrying out a few more experiments along
        lines that look promising or are new avenues of thought, as far
        as I am aware. In tandem, properly open sourcing my previous
        research endeavour.</p>
        <p>Though I could do the classic thing and live with my parents
        for a year (or indefinitely), and I am incredibly grateful for
        that stop gap, I have some funds saved up so after the usual
        holiday period I wish to enter the “real world”. My goal is to
        get a job, ideally somehow involved in machine learning
        research, hopefully near other people actively in research, or
        something that gives more experience in the field. That could be
        a very lofty goal and I may have a massive comeuppance. I will
        see and you may already know.</p>
        <p>I hope to have more regular blogs detailing this journey as
        it unfolds either as a “This is how I did xyz to achieve abc” or
        potentially “Don’t do xyz you won’t get anywhere”.</p>
