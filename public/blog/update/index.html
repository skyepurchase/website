        <p>So much for regular blogs. The issue is wanting to publish
        articles that I’ve put a lot of thought into, or worse: thinking
        about the blog itself rather than the content.</p>
        <p>So where am I? I’m back in the university working with the
        same department as an Research Assistant! I’m working within
        educational technology getting experience with full stack
        development but also research within the field. I’m taking
        courses in Advanced Category Theory, helping with supervisions,
        and reading groups and seminars. For the most part my goals are
        complete!</p>
        <p>I’m not directly working in research, I’m falling behind on
        masters applications, I don’t feel I’m spending as much time as
        I would like learning what I set out to learn. BUT, I am as
        close to the position I wanted to be in that I could reasonably
        be in.</p>
        <p>I hope to produce more of these in the coming weeks or
        months. Literally sitting down for 30-60min and write something
        I’ve been thinking about. Maybe not publish it and slowly build
        on it, but I don’t want to wait until the moment is
        “perfect”.</p>
