        <p>Slow progress as I struggled to open a file in C using Clang
        as the compiler. Switching to GCC resulted in the code working
        as I had assumed. I will look into the issue further and
        hopefully gain a better understanding of the differences.</p>
        <p>Since this change I have implemented a basic file handler in
        <code>file_handler.c</code> and finished a tokenizer in
        <code>parser.c</code>.</p>
        <p>The AST for Brainf**k is basically just a sequence except for
        the loops which are simple
        <code>do ...; x--; while x != 0</code>. This constitutes the
        only control flow in Brainf**k, but the language is still Turing
        complete and can be seen in comparison to <em><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine">register
        machines</a></em> (RMs).</p>
        <p>The major difference is that RMs use a form of
        <code>goto</code> rather than loops where control flow happens
        on decriment. A decriment operation in an RM is written as such:
        <code>Rx- L1 L2</code> where <code>x</code> is the register
        number and <code>Lx</code> is a label to go to. If the contents
        of <code>Rx</code> are zero jump to <code>L2</code> otherwise
        decriment <code>Rx</code> and jump to <code>L1</code>. <em>note
        that increment still contains a label <code>Rx+ L1</code> and so
        instructions are not necessary sequential.</em></p>
        <p>Before writing a compiler to 6502 machine code I want to
        write a transpiler from Brainf**k to RM. From Brainf**k to RM
        this should be fairly trivial as <code>++[&gt;++&lt;]</code>
        becomes</p>
        <pre><code>L0 R0+ L1       +
L1 R0+ L2       +

L2 R1+ L3       [&gt;+
L3 R1+ L4       +
L4 R0- L2 L5    &lt;]

L5 HALT</code></pre>
        <p>In this case the loop is identified and a decriment added at
        the end jumping to the beginning of the loop or falling through.
        The code is made sequential.</p>
        <p>Decriment can then have a fail condition which jumps to the
        final halt of the program. Thus <code>++&gt;+[&lt;-&gt;]</code>
        becomes</p>
        <pre><code>L0 R0+ L1       +
L1 R0+ L2       +
L2 R1+ L3       &gt;+

L3 R0- L4 L5    [&lt;-
L4 R1- L3 L6    &gt;]

L5 HALT
L6 HALT</code></pre>
        <p><em>note that with a minor optimisation the
        <code>HALT</code>s can be combined</em></p>
        <p>So the next step is to parse the tokens into an AST where all
        decriments are control flow and all loops are converted to
        decriments.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>No progress on the actual code however I noticed a mistake in
        how I interpretted Brainf**k and found an example of a
        potentially problematic program.</p>
        <h3 id="brainfk">Brainf**k</h3>
        <p>Brainf**k uses 8 characters of which only 7 are practical on
        an 8-bit machine as input is tricky. These symbols are
        <code>+ - &lt; &gt; [ ] . ,</code> for increment, decriment,
        left, right, begin-loop, loop-if-zero, output, and (the removed)
        input.</p>
        <p>Note that <code>]</code> is <em>loop-if-zero</em> and thus
        does not decriment the counter unlike <code>Rx-</code> in RMs.
        Further more <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> just
        increment or decriment a register counter which can be a
        different value at the start of each loop.</p>
        <h3 id="rms">RMs</h3>
        <p>RMs have 2 actions <code>Rx+</code> (from now on denoted
        <code>ADD</code>) and <code>Rx-</code> (from now on denoted
        <code>SUB</code>). It also has labels that can be jumped to
        after each <code>ADD</code> and <code>SUB</code>. It does not
        have explicit loops and <em>it has fixed register
        operations</em>!</p>
        <h3 id="the-changes">The changes</h3>
        <p>Based on the new interpretation of Brainf**k this means the
        program <code>++[&gt;++&lt;]</code> does not terminate as
        <code>R0</code> remains at <code>2</code> throughout. It must
        therefore be <code>++[&gt;++&lt;-]</code> to prevent
        non-termination but could also be <code>++[-&gt;++&lt;]</code>
        or even <code>++[&gt;+&lt;-&gt;+&lt;]</code> just to demonstrate
        that it is difficult to change a loop into a simple
        <code>SUB</code> operation.</p>
        <p>If the program contains a <code>-]</code> this can be
        directly converted to a <code>SUB</code> with a “zero-jump” back
        to a previous label. A “lonely” <code>-</code> can be converted
        to a <code>SUB</code> with a “zero-jump” to a <code>HALT</code>
        instructions. <em>unfortunately no error codes in
        Brainf**k</em>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, <code>&gt;&gt;[+&lt;]</code> is a valid program
        which does halt. It corresponds to the following RM program:</p>
        <pre><code>L0 R2+ L1
L1 R1+ L2
L2 HALT</code></pre>
        <p>Note that the loop has to be unrolled because of the
        requirement of fixed registers.</p>
        <h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Once the program is tokenized we want to “push”
        <code>-</code> as late as possible so that they may “collide”
        with a loop character, <code>[</code> or <code>]</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><code>++[-&gt;++&lt;]</code>,
        <code>++[&gt;&lt;-&gt;++&lt;]</code>,
        <code>++[&gt;+&lt;-&gt;+&lt;]</code>, etc. all become
        <code>++[&gt;++&lt;-]</code> which is the program we can easily
        convert into RM code. <em>NOTE</em> no decriment should be
        pushed outside of or after a loop as this can change the control
        flow.</p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>The <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> need to be
        tracked inside of a loop. If they are balanced then the register
        count at the start of the loop is the same and thus can be
        converted to an RM loop.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If they are not balanced the compiler will through an error …
        at the moment. Figuring out how many times a loop will run is
        not tractable (as it requires running the program to work out)
        and setting up the operation for all possible starting register
        counts is also not possible as there are countably infinite
        possibilities.</p>
        <p>Quick notes on this problem:</p>
        <p>An RM program exists that can run any Brainf**k program by
        simulating the register states and interpretting the “compiled”
        Brainf**k program. By “compiled” I mean the Godel-esque number
        (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Godel
        numbering</a>) corresponding to the the Brainf**k program. The
        opposite is also true. Maybe I’ll post an in-depth explanation
        about this later (the <em>theory of computation</em> is a
        fascinating concept).</p>
        <p>This means that Brainf**k is not “more powerful” than RMs and
        in fact, by the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing
        thesis</a>, are equally powerful being Turing complete.</p>
        <p>However, this does not mean converting from one form to the
        other is easy (or possible? I’m not confident on that last
        point, guess I need to prove that these weird loops definitively
        cannot be converted … bringing in the Halting problem
        :eyes:).</p>
        <p><em>ALSO</em> any Brainf**k program can be rewritten to do
        the same action without using this “hack” but the onous is now
        on the programmer. This is a common feature of compilers,
        computers are dumb they can only do so much, think about your
        code!</p>
